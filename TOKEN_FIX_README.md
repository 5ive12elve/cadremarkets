# Token Storage Fix for Cross-Origin Authentication

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing authentication issues where:
1. Users could sign in successfully
2. Tokens were being stored in localStorage/sessionStorage
3. But subsequent API calls were failing with 401 Unauthorized errors
4. This was particularly problematic with the cross-origin setup (www.cadremarkets.com ↔ api.cadremarkets.com)

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Timing Issues**: Tokens were being stored after navigation to the homepage, causing race conditions
2. **Cross-Origin Cookie Issues**: Cookies weren't being properly set for cross-origin requests
3. **Token Retrieval Race Conditions**: API calls were being made before tokens were fully stored
4. **Inconsistent Token Storage**: Tokens were stored in multiple locations but retrieval wasn't consistent

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Token Storage Timing Fix

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/pages/SignIn.jsx`
- `client/src/components/OAuth.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added 200ms delay after Redux dispatch to ensure state is updated
- Increased navigation delay from 100ms to 300ms
- Added verification of Redux state before navigation
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Enhanced Token Retrieval Logic

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/utils/authenticatedFetch.js`

**Changes:**
- Added retry logic (up to 2 retries) for failed requests
- Enhanced token retrieval from multiple sources
- Added token format validation
- Improved error handling for 401 responses
- Added fallback token retrieval from Redux state and user object

### 3. Backend Cookie Configuration Fix

**Files Modified:**
- `api/controllers/auth.controller.js`

**Changes:**
- Improved cookie options for cross-origin compatibility
- Added `path: '/'` to ensure cookies are available for all paths
- Removed domain restrictions that were causing cross-origin issues
- Enhanced debugging and logging
- Separated cookie setting from response sending

### 4. Debug Utilities

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/utils/debug-token.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `testCompleteAuthFlow()` function for comprehensive testing
- Enhanced existing debug functions
- Added global window functions for easy console debugging

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Console Debugging

Open the browser console and run these commands:

```javascript
// Quick token status check
debugTokenNow()

// Test current token with API
testTokenNow()

// Complete authentication flow test
testCompleteAuthFlow()

// Detailed token flow analysis
testTokenFlow()
```

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

1. **Clear all storage:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   sessionStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Sign in to the application**

3. **Check token storage:**
   ```javascript
   debugTokenNow()
   ```

4. **Navigate to profile page**

5. **Check if user listings load properly**

6. **Test API calls:**
   ```javascript
   testTokenNow()
   ```

### 3. Expected Behavior

After the fixes:
- ✅ Tokens should be stored immediately after signin
- ✅ Navigation should wait for token storage to complete
- ✅ API calls should include proper Authorization headers
- ✅ Cross-origin requests should work with both cookies and Bearer tokens
- ✅ Failed requests should retry with different token sources
- ✅ 401 errors should trigger proper cleanup and redirect

### 4. Debug Information

The fixes include extensive logging. Check the browser console for:
- `=== SIGNIN RESPONSE DEBUG ===`
- `=== ENHANCED TOKEN STORAGE ===`
- `=== IMMEDIATE STORAGE VERIFICATION ===`
- `=== WAITING FOR REDUX UPDATE ===`
- `=== PRE-NAVIGATION TOKEN CHECK ===`
- `=== AUTHENTICATED FETCH DEBUG ===`
- `=== FETCH ATTEMPT X/Y ===`

## Production Considerations

1. **Cross-Origin Setup**: The fixes are specifically designed for the www.cadremarkets.com ↔ api.cadremarkets.com setup
2. **Cookie Security**: Cookies are set with `httpOnly: true`, `secure: true` (in production), and `sameSite: 'none'`
3. **Token Fallback**: The system uses both cookies and Bearer tokens for maximum compatibility
4. **Retry Logic**: Failed requests are retried up to 2 times with exponential backoff

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics in production:
- Signin success rate
- API call success rate
- 401 error frequency
- Token storage success rate
- Cross-origin request success rate

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist, you can:
1. Revert the timing changes in SignIn.jsx and OAuth.jsx
2. Remove the retry logic from authenticatedFetch.js
3. Revert cookie changes in auth.controller.js
4. The debug utilities can remain as they don't affect functionality
