# Cadre Markets API - Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Cadre Markets** is an art and collectibles marketplace platform where users can list, browse, and purchase art pieces. The platform includes user authentication, listing management, order processing, and administrative tools.

## ✅ Test Suite Implementation Complete

I have successfully analyzed the entire codebase and implemented a comprehensive automated test suite covering all critical API endpoints with a focus on business-critical functionality, security, and edge cases.
